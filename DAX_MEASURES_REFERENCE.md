## üí° Usage Tips

### 1. Creating Measures in Power BI
1. Go to **Modeling** tab
2. Click **New Measure**
3. Copy and paste the DAX code
4. Rename the measure appropriately

### 2. Using Measures in Visuals
- Drag measures to **Values** field
- Use in KPI cards for key metrics
- Combine with dimensions for analysis

### 3. Error Handling
- Always use `DIVIDE()` instead of `/` to handle division by zero
- Use `ISBLANK()` to check for empty values
- Add `0` as default value in DIVIDE function

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Use `CALCULATE()` for filtered calculations
- Prefer `SUM()` over `SUMX()` when possible
- Create base measures and reference them in complex calculations
