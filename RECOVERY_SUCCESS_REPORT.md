## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Test the Recovery
- Open `esf_dashboard.html` in your browser (if it exists)
- Run any of the Python scripts to generate new outputs
- Verify data files load correctly

### 2. Start Using the Project
- Generate interactive dashboards for presentations
- Create visualizations for reports
- Import DAX measures into Power BI
- Analyze the sample data to understand patterns

### 3. Customize for Your Needs
- Replace sample data with real ESF datasets
- Modify KPI calculations as needed
- Adjust dashboard styling and branding
- Add additional analysis features

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Python Scripts Don't Run
- Install required packages: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`
- Use a proper Python environment (3.8+ recommended)
- Check the `test_project.py` for basic functionality

### If Dashboards Don't Load
- Ensure data files exist in `cleaned_data/` folder
- Check internet connection for Chart.js CDN
- Verify HTML files aren't corrupted
